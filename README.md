================

I made these applications to broaden my skill set.<br>

It_Was_A_Good_Day.apk<br> 
This app plays Ice Cube's It Was A Good Day song when opened. The app
also displays the lyrics of the song.  Clicking on the Facebook
button will direct you to Ice Cube's Facebook page.
Clicking on the Twitter button will direct you to Ice Cube's Twitter
page. Finally, clicking on Meme will direct you to a meme page.<br>

This app will forward you to different links based on what you click.
